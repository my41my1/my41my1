So what exactly is a payday loan? It tends to be a short-term, usually high-cost, cash advance where you pay a fee to borrow money (for example, a $15 fee for every $100 borrowed) and you are expected to pay it back in a short time, usually a couple of weeks. People often tell us that the MLA cap of 36 percent seems like a pretty high limit – but what they don’t realize is that the average annual percentage rate on a payday loan like the one above is 390 percent! And if you roll over the loan repeatedly because you can’t pay it off like you hoped you could, then the cost can skyrocket over time. We’ve seen examples of payday loan borrowers who end up paying far more in fees than the amount they originally borrowed. In some cases they could have gone to one of the military relief societies, if it was an emergency, and gotten a loan at zero percent interest. Yes, zero – no fee at all.
